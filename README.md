# Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to insights delivery through dashboards and reports.

The objective is to analyze the dataset, extract meaningful patterns using Python and SQL, and communicate insights effectively using Power BI and presentations.

The project is designed to reflect real-world analytics work, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, querying relational databases, and stakeholder-ready reporting.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded raw dataset into Python using Pandas
- Validated schema, data types, and row counts

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics and data distributions
- Identification of outliers and anomalies
- Trend and pattern analysis using visualizations

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing and duplicate values
- Standardizing formats and column names
- Feature-level consistency checks

### 4. Database & SQL Analysis
- Imported cleaned data into a relational database
- Executed SQL queries to:
  - Aggregate metrics
  - Perform multi-table joins
  - Extract business-level insights
- Queries written to be portable across PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server

### 5. Dashboard Development
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Key components include:
  - KPIs and summary cards
  - Trend analysis
  - Filters and slicers for interactive exploration

### 6. Reporting & Presentation
- Created a structured analytics report explaining insights
- Converted findings into a professional presentation using Gamma
- Focused on clarity, visuals, and business relevance
